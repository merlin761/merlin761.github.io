My name is Merlin Martinez and i am an alumni at Southern New Hampshire University , majored in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering! I had the pleasure to work with the best professors and learn from them i will be leaving here down bellow my best projects i did while i was in Southern New Hampshire University where i gained skills and knowledge from my professors.

## *Table of Content*
1. Professional Self-Assessment
2. Code Review
3. Software Design and Engineering: Zoo Code Translation
4. Algorithms and Data Structure: Project Two CS 410
5. Databases:Project Two CS 410 MongoDB Database Enhancement

### *Professional Self-Assessment:*
<p style="text-indent: 55px;"> 
While being a student here at SNHU wasthough for me however i can say i learned a lot in the mids of a new baby, job and moving to a new state was able to finish my major and learn from the very best professors that taught me knew skils in computer science i had the luck to learn about databases, security, Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, testing and many more classes that have taught valuable lessons in my future. even tho i loved every single class and i had my difficulties in life i made sure even if it was though to spend the whole night if it was necessary to learn the material, to ask questions to peers and professors even if i learned a lot i hope i can keep learning every day more so i can continue my path and my pation in the tecnology field. it was not a easy road many slepless night where i cried and i told myself i couldnt do it because the class was hard i was ablke to learn and pass my classes even while i was in the hospital i made sure to finish my homework because i wanted a better future for myself as well i wanted finish my carrer in the field i loved since i was a kid. I this is my beggining of just one finish line i know i will be a better programer i will keep becoming better with every year that comes by.

## **Code Review**

<p style="text-indent: 55px;"> 

My code review video contains the three artifacts. I made sure to analyze each artifact separately for any errors, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses to make sure i was able to deliver a reliable project.in the video i spoke about all the improvements/enhancements for each artifact.

Inn the video i made sure to  show case the existing functionalities of each artifact as well the enhancements what areas i was going to update and how i was going to make the artifact better in addition to the code Analysis where i show case the planned enhancements that address issues raised in the code analysis.

## **Artifact 1 Software Engineering and Design**

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">

The artifact I have chosen for Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering is the last project from my class CS 340 
Grazioso Salvare where i was able to transferring the language from python to C++. this was not a easy project because i had to re do the data base using mongodb input all the data to ensure the code was wroking like it was supposed to. My use of the C++ programming language in this project hcan show the impressive improvement i had throught the pass years it help me enhance the structure of the code to better the system. In addition to how I designed and evaluated the computing solutions i was able to solve the given problem using proper code design and computer science practices standards with appropriate solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in the code design choices. i made sure to make minimal changes just the necessary changes to make sure my code work properly and is easy to understand.

## **Artifact 2 Algorithms and Data Structures** 
## **Artifact 3 Databases**


<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
This was my final project from my class CS 410, where we had to reverse and correct the bugs to make the code from O to C++. This was my last project from last semester back in Sept 2024. The reason why I chose this project was because I liked the project since we had to add whatever we wanted to make the design of the code better, which I think I did a pretty good job on; however, I felt like I could have done a better job in the security aspect, and I think I can change that now that I'm given the opportunity. like I can make sure the code is better structured and I use a safe and better way to access the clients information, like storing the passwords asÂ  an encryptio and adding it to the database so it can be accessed with no issues, making the code more secure with a built-in database to save data and a safe password.
