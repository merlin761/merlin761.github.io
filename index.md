### *Professional Self-Assessment:*

While being a student here at SNHU wasthough for me however i can say i learned a lot in the mids of a new baby, job and moving to a new state was able to finish my major and learn from the very best professors that taught me knew skils in computer science i had the luck to learn about databases, security, Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, testing and many more classes that have taught valuable lessons in my future. even tho i loved every single class and i had my difficulties in life i made sure even if it was though to spend the whole night if it was necessary to learn the material, to ask questions to peers and professors even if i learned a lot i hope i can keep learning every day more so i can continue my path and my pation in the tecnology field. it was not a easy road many slepless night where i cried and i told myself i couldnt do it because the class was hard i was ablke to learn and pass my classes even while i was in the hospital i made sure to finish my homework because i wanted a better future for myself as well i wanted finish my carrer in the field i loved since i was a kid. I this is my beggining of just one finish line i know i will be a better programer i will keep becoming better with every year that comes by.
