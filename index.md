## Welcome to Merlin Software Engineering ePortfolio


My name is Merlin Martinez and i am a student at Southern New Hampshire University, I majored in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I had the pleasure of working with the best professors and learning from them. I will be leaving here down below my best projects i did while i was at Southern New Hampshire University, where i gained skills and knowledge from my professors.

### *Professional Self-Assessment:*

While being a student here at SNHU was though for me, however i can say i learned a lot in the midst of a new baby, job and moving to a new state i was able to finish my major and learn from the very best professors, these great professors taught me knew skills in computer science i had the luck to learn about databases, security, Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance and many more classes that have taught valuable lessons for my future. Even though I loved every single class, and I had my difficulties in life I made sure to spend the whole night if it was necessary to learn the material, to ask questions to peers and professors. I hope I can keep learning every day more so I can continue my path and my passion in the technology field. It was not an easy road for many sleepless nights where I cried and I told myself I couldn’t do it because the class was hard or that I was not going to learn nor pass my classes, even while I was in the hospital I made sure to finish my homework because I wanted a better future for myself. I didn’t want to give up because i had people betting for me, telling me constantly not to give up and giving me a hand, in addition, i always had so much passion for technology since i was young. This is my beginning and not the finish line I know I will be a better programmer I will keep becoming better with every year that comes by.

On this Eportfolio i will be able to demonstrate my knowledge using C++, MongoDB, assembly, security mindset and UI/UX. While I was in school, I worked in multiples projects with classmates one of them was building a UI/UX schema, we were supposed to update a web app and make updates to make sure it was easy for the users. In addition, not only did I learn about team collaborations but also how to communicate with stakeholders. I did multiple activities throughout my classes in SNHU about how I can ensure I deliver a good well-rounded product so the stakeholders can be happy. In the Software Development Lifecycle, I also learned about the different types of roles like for example QA, product owner, project manager, developer, etc.


## **Course Outcomes**

Course Outcome # 1

While doing my course outcome number one i was able to do a code review that allowed me to have a better and deeper understanding on what needs to change or what areas i need to improve.

Course Outcome #2

For this course outcome i was able to design a written communication that was understandable even for people that have not knowledge in programing. Artifact number one  Software Engineering and Design i was able to translate my code from python to C++ so i can show case my skills in C++.

Course Outcome #3

For this outcome i was able to finish many outcomes and implement the best solutions to my program by completing my project in Algorithms and Data Structures i was able to make sure the structure of the project was fluent and did what it was supposed to i added multiple things like ensuring the users have to authenticate and input a password before accesing any type of information as well ensuring that when the wrong password is input, they are unable to acces any other prompts in addition to terminating the program.

Course Outcomes #4 

I was able to demostrate my skills using databases in this course outcome i was able to create a MongoDB database in order to add private information like different passwords and user, ensuring that users informations where kept safe and private from outsiders allowing me to remove the password from the main code.


## **Code Review**


My code review video contains the three artifacts. I made sure to analyze each artifact separately for any errors, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses to make sure i was able to deliver a reliable project.in the video i spoke about all the improvements/enhancements for each artifact.

In the video i made sure to  show case the existing functionalities of each artifact as well the enhancements what areas i was going to update and how i was going to make the artifact better in addition to the code Analysis where i show case the planned enhancements that address issues raised in the code analysis.

## **Artifact 1 Software Engineering and Design**


The artifact I have chosen for Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering is the last project from my class CS 340 
Grazioso Salvare where i was able to transferring the language from python to C++. this was not a easy project because i had to re do the data base using mongodb input all the data to ensure the code was wroking like it was supposed to. My use of the C++ programming language in this project hcan show the impressive improvement i had throught the pass years it help me enhance the structure of the code to better the system. In addition to how I designed and evaluated the computing solutions i was able to solve the given problem using proper code design and computer science practices standards with appropriate solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in the code design choices. i made sure to make minimal changes just the necessary changes to make sure my code work properly and is easy to understand.

## **Artifact 2 Algorithms and Data Structures** 
## **Artifact 3 Databases**


This was my final project from my class CS 410, where we had to reverse and correct the bugs to make the code from O to C++. This was my last project from last semester back in Sept 2024. The reason why I chose this project was because I liked the project since we had to add whatever we wanted to make the design of the code better, which I think I did a pretty good job on; however, I felt like I could have done a better job in the security aspect, and I think I can change that now that I'm given the opportunity. like I can make sure the code is better structured and I use a safe and better way to access the clients information, like storing the passwords as  an encryptio and adding it to the database so it can be accessed with no issues, making the code more secure with a built-in database to save data and a safe password.
